<p align="center">
  A Spring Boot REST API that connects people to <b>accessible</b> places — search, verify, and book, all in one flow.
</p>

---

## Overview

Wusool lets business owners register places with structured **accessibility details** (ramps, elevators, accessible restrooms, parking, etc.), lets users **search and filter** by real accessibility features and book a visit in one step, and adds an **AI assistant** (Gemini) for free‑text accessibility questions plus automatic **email/WhatsApp** booking notifications.

**Stack:** Spring Boot · Spring Data JPA / Hibernate · MySQL · Jakarta Validation · Gemini API · Spring Mail · UltraMsg (WhatsApp)

Base URL (local): `http://localhost:8080`
